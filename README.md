# Welcome to my UCLA Master of Science in Statistics and Data Science Thesis!

I'm honored that you'd visit this repo. If you'd like any additional information, please let me know on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devin-reeh-77374bb2/) or email me at [devin.recuiters@gmail.com](devin.recuiters@gmail.com) (even if you aren't a recruiter).


## Getting Started:
I'd suggest you read the paper abstract below first. Then, clone the repo. The final code file that generates the final results are in titled 'final'. The final.rmd is the r markdown file which you can clone and edit. The final.pdf is the knitted version of the markdown file. The final paper extracts the key findings from the code and research.

## Abstract
This thesis examines the causal effects of poverty based eligibility thresholds on school level outcomes in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The analysis focuses on two administrative metrics used to allocate resources and services: Free and Reduced-Price Meals (FRPM) eligibility and Unduplicated Pupil Percentage (UPP). Leveraging 35 percent 55 percent, and 75 percent levels as policy based cutoffs, the study applies both classical Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and its Bayesian extension, Gaussian Process Re- gression Discontinuity Design (GP-RDD), to estimate local treatment effects. Using administrative data from the 2021-2022 academic year, this research evaluates the effects of qualifying for supplemental funding support on chronic absenteeism, standardized test performance in English Language Arts and Mathematics (ELA), and participation in the Beyond the Bell (BTB) after-school program. Effects on chronic absenteeism are small and statistically insignificant at both the 35% and 75% FRPM thresholds. Under classical RDD at 35%, the point estimate is +6.48 percentage points (95% CI: [−1.78, 14.74], p = 0.124), and under GP–RDD it is +7.87 percentage points (95% CrI: [−3.38, 19.11], p = 0.171). At 75%, estimates are near zero and non–significant across methods.


## For students from the UCLA MAS program
I'd recommend you read the paper and clone the structure, and modify it as you see fit. I've stood on the shoulders of giants and greatly benefited from their generosity in sharing the templats and theses formats! Best of luck.

## Mentions
While I have a dedication page, I want to give a huge shout out to Professor Chad Hazlett for his guidance as my thesis advisor. Additionally, in no particular order, thank you Dr. Michael Tsiang, Laurie Leyden, Rick Schoenberg, and the entire masters teaching faculty at UCLA.  


## Parting Message and some unsolicited advice to myself, my family, and any other reader
I'm the first graduate degree holder in my family. Knowing that 1.1 million people graduate every year with a graduate degree made it easy to relegate like my pursuit of higher learning. However, when I saw my family, saw where they'd come from and overcome, it became clear how fortunate I was to have been an opportunity to achieve such a milestone. I'm forever grateful to my champions and supporters.

To those who feel lost, seek ways to be in service to other people in a community - friends, family, work, volunteer. A lot of wiser people suggest this.

To those to come, who are doubtful or critical of their own abilities, I'd like to impart an idea:

To those to come, who are struggling, "Nobody does anything without help.” - [Uncle Phil, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwQ3x2rpm_o&ab_channel=Rendell%2CLikeDenzel)
**Find help**

In summary, help others, ask for help, and work like hell.
